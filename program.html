                            Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Sequential Motifs in Observed Walks
                            <span style="width:500px;">The structure of complex networks can be characterized by counting and analyzing network motifs, which are small graph structures that occur repeatedly in a network, such as triangles or chains. Recent work has generalized motifs to temporal and dynamic network data. However, existing techniques do not generalize to sequential or trajectory data, which represents entities walking through the nodes of a network, such as passengers moving through transportation networks. The unit of observation in these data is fundamentally different, since we analyze observations of walks (e.g., a trip from airport A to airport C through airport B), rather than independent observations of edges or snapshots of graphs over time. In this work, we define sequential motifs in trajectory data, which are small, directed, and sequenced-ordered graphs corresponding to patterns in observed sequences. We draw a connection between counting and analysis of sequential motifs and Higher-Order Network (HON) models. We show that by mapping edges of a HON, specifically a kth-order DeBruijn graph, to sequential motifs, we can count and evaluate their importance in observed data, and we test our proposed methodology with two datasets: (1) passengers navigating an airport network and (2) people navigating the Wikipedia article network. We find that the most prevalent and important sequential motifs correspond to intuitive patterns of traversal in the real systems, and show empirically that the heterogeneity of edge weights in an observed higher-order DeBruijn graph has implications for the distributions of sequential motifs we expect to see across our null models.

                            Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Modelling dynamics on clustered networks using multi-type branching processes.

                            <span style="width:500px;">
                                Online social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok serve as media for the spread of information between their users. We are interested in developing models for this information diffusion to gain a greater understanding of its drivers. Some models for the spread of online behaviour and information assume that the information behaves similarly to a virus, where infection is equally likely after each exposure, these dynamics are known as a simple contagion. In a simple contagion, the exposures are independent of each other. However, online adoption of some behaviour and content has been empirically observed to be more likely after multiple exposures from their network neighbours [1-2], the exposures are not independent of each other, we refer to this as a complex contagion. Analytically tractable descriptions of complex contagions have been developed for continuous-time dynamics. These extend mean-field and pair approximation methods to account for clustering in the network topologies [3]; however, no such analogous treatments for discrete-time cascade processes exist using branching processes. We describe a novel definition of complex contagion adoption dynamics and show how to construct multi-type branching processes which account for clustering on networks [4]. We achieve this by tracking the evolution of a cascade via different classes of clique motifs which contain different numbers of active, inactive and removed nodes. This description allows for accurate analytical calculation of cascade sizes, determination of critical behaviour and we also describe how the branching process description allows us, using probability generating functions, to derive full distributions of cascade sizes and other quantities of interest from the model.

                            Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Mapping regularized higher-order network flows

                            <span style="width:500px;">To capture modular regularities in sequence data or data describing interactions across multiple layers, the flow-based community detection method, known as the map equation, uses higher-order network flow models. Unlike first-order models, where each node has a single community assignment, higher-order models allow nodes to be assigned to several communities and identify overlapping communities. The map equation performs well when enough data are provided, but in the case of insufficient data, it is prone to overfit and requires flow regularization. Because higher-order models have higher complexity than first-order models, with degrees of freedom that grow exponentially with their order, the risk to overfit becomes more pronounced as we increase order, requiring considerably more data to detect reliable communities. We have recently proposed a Bayesian approach that overcomes the problem of overfitting in plain networks with incomplete data, that is, memoryless networks with one layer. Here we extend the idea behind the Bayesian estimate of the transition rates for plain networks to regularize flows in memory and multilayer networks. Our results in synthetic networks with planted community structures show that the map equation with regularized higher-order flows outperforms the standard map equation and enables more robust community detection in sparse empirical data.

                            <span style="width:500px;">We introduce time-ordered multibody interactions to describe complex systems manifesting temporal as well as multibody dependencies. First, we show how the dynamics of multivariate Markov chains can be decomposed in ensembles of time-ordered multibody interactions. Then, we present an algorithm to extract combined interactions from data and a measure to characterize the complexity of interaction ensembles. Finally, we experimentally validate the robustness of our algorithm against statistical errors and its efficiency at obtaining simple interaction ensembles.

                            Contributed Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Advances in the Louvain Algorithm for Hierarchical Community Detection in Psychological Data
                                <span style="width:500px;">Psychological data usually follow a hierarchical organization, with lower order traits (e.g., spatial scanning and mental rotation) nested within higher order ones (e.g., visual processing). This feature has often been neglected in applied research, especially in exploratory settings, hindering progress in areas like intelligence, personality, and psychopathology. Using Gaussian Graphical Models combined with the Louvain community detection algorithm and consensus clustering, we present a two-stage approach we call hierarchical exploratory graph analysis (hierEGA) to estimate hierarchical community structures. We introduce a novel approach to aggregate nodes in the Louvain algorithm, using latent weighted scores, rather than summing edges, to form aggregate nodes. An exhaustive Monte Carlo simulation tested the accuracy of hierEGA to detect the correct number of lower and higher order communities. hierEGA displayed a good hit rate for the number of lower-order communities and a close to perfect hit rate for the number of higher-order communities. Our approach to aggregate nodes in the Louvain algorithm significantly outperformed the original Louvain algorithm. Furthermore, it remained robust to conditions commonly encountered in psychological research, like low sample size and noisy data. Therefore, we regard hierEGA as a reliable tool for the estimation of hierarchical structures in psychological data and beyond.
