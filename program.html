                                Giulia Cencetti is a postdoc at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento (Italy). She has a rich and interdisciplinary background: physicist by training, she obtained a PhD in Information Engineering working on complex systems and in particular on dynamical systems on complex networks. She developed different models to explore the impact of network topology on the dynamical behavior of a system, having as a ultimate goal to apply a strategic external control, with applications in biology, ecosystems stability, urban traffic and information flow. After PhD, she spent some months at the Department of Networks and Data Science at the Central European University (then in Budapest, now in Wien) where she started to explore the new emerging mathematical branch of higher-order networks. Then she contributed to a review on the topic, published at Physics Reports. In FBK she is exploiting her experience and theoretical knowledge to study social applications: her research spans from urban science to human interactions data analysis. Recently, she worked on a project of digital tracing for Covid-19, result of a big international collaboration.

                            Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Random walk, synchronization and time-dependent social networks beyond pairwise interactions
                            <span style="width:500px;">In the last thirty years network science has proven its strength in modelling many real-world interacting systems as generic agents, the nodes, connected by pairwise edges. Yet, in many relevant cases, interactions are not pairwise but involve larger sets of nodes, at a time. These systems are thus better described in the framework of higher-order networks, whose different orders connections effectively account for multi-body interactions. This intuition has recently opened the perspective to a new branch of network science, involving hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. At this point in history it is worthwhile to re-examine the plethora of systems which have been addressed through network science and wonder how they would appear if assuming a higher-order point of view. Let us consider for instance two of the most simple dynamical processes on networks: random walk and synchronization of oscillatory systems. Both processes are thoroughly described by an apt Laplacian operator in the standard pairwise setting and its generalization to higher-order has been the subject of multiple recent studies. Moving to more applicative scenarios, higher-order networks are useful to study social contexts, in order to seize the intrinsic dynamics of individuals’ behaviors when plunged into a collectivity, where social dynamics are hardly ascribable to pairwise settings and often comprise larger groups simultaneously interacting. Temporal hypergraphs hence qualify as a suitable tool to describe them. By analyzing social interactions datasets we find that higherorder interactions are ubiquitous and, similarly to their pairwise counterparts, characterized by heterogeneous dynamics. In conclusion, it is important to stress how higher-order structures of mutual interactions enrich investigation of both simple dynamical process and human temporal dynamics.

                            Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> The role of higher-order interactions in the dynamics of social contagion and convention
                            <span style="width:500px;">Dynamical processes that emulate human behaviors have been the focus of many studies, where social relationships and interactions are typically considered as an underlying structure. As shown recently in various contexts, it is moreover important to take into account the fact that individuals do not interact only in pairs but also in larger groups. Social interactions are indeed a natural testing ground for higher-order approaches. In this talk, I will discuss the effects of considering group interactions on the dynamics of social systems. In particular, I will generalize two models of social contagion and norm evolution, initially introduced and studied on graphs, and now extended as dynamical processes on hypergraphs. Leveraging real-world interaction data and analytical insights, I will show the emergence of novel phenomena such as discontinuous transitions and critical mass effects induced by higher-order interactions. After allowing for the presence of a committed minority, I will show that the ability of committed individuals to overturn an existing norm is non-monotonic in the number of participants in higher-order interactions. These results provide theoretical support to the observation that extremely small minorities can overcome the opinion of the corresponding large majority of the population. Overall, the findings confirm the relevance of going beyond network representations when modeling social phenomena.

                            <span style="width:500px;">
                              To connect structure, dynamics and function in systems with multibody interactions, network scientists model random walks on hypergraphs and identify communities that confine the walks for a long time.  The two flow-based community-detection methods Markov stability and the map equation identify such communities based on different principles and search algorithms.  But how similar are the resulting communities? We explain both methods' machinery applied to hypergraphs and compare them on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs using various hyperedge-size biased random walks and time scales. We find that the map equation is more sensitive to time-scale changes and that Markov stability is more sensitive to hyperedge-size biases.

                            <span style="width:500px;">
                              Our understanding of the dynamics of complex
                              networked systems has increased significantly in
                              the last two decades. However, most of our
                              knowledge is built upon assuming pairwise
                              relations among the system's components. This
                              assumption is often an oversimplification, for
                              instance, in social interactions that frequently
                              occur within groups.  For example, in WhatsApp or
                              Telegram groups, the messages follow a one-to-many
                              pattern of transmission. To overcome this
                              limitation, here we study the dynamics of social
                              contagion on hypergraphs, a mathematical object
                              that imposes virtually no constraint regarding
                              sizes. In this talk, we will discuss an analytical
                              framework to study social contagion dynamics on
                              arbitrary hypergraphs. Moreover, we will support
                              our analytical results with numerical results and
                              Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses show that
                              the model has a very rich parameter space with
                              continuous and discontinuous transitions,
                              bistability, and hysteresis. We will also discuss
                              how this model opens new research paths on
                              higher-order models and the analytical treatment
                              of hypergraphs, posing further questions about
                              modeling dynamical processes on higher-order
                              structures.

                            <span style="width:500px;">
                              The investigation of temporal networks and dynamic systems evolving on them has become a vivid area of research in recent years. Alas, the zoo of open source software that facilitates their modeling and analysis is sparsely populated. Here, I demonstrate the use of the C++(fast)-based Python(simple) package “tacoma” [1], which aims to do exactly that. I’ll show how to convert temporal networks between popular formats, perform simple analyses of their structure and temporal statistics, visualize them interactively, and simulate canonical disease spreading models on them. I’ll continue the demo with “epipack” [2], a Python package that I developed over the last year at Germany’s public health institute to build and analyze complex infectious disease models at lightning speed. “epipack”  allows users to easily perform numerical, analytical, and stochastic analyses of complex spreading models, latent or with interactive elements, as well as stochastic simulations on (un/)weighted, (un/)directed networks. Because “epipack” also has a built-in framework to visualize your custom-built spreading models on networks, I’ll showcase “netwulf” [3] in concurrence, which I co-developed with Ulf Aslak to facilitate layouting your static networks interactively in Python.

                            Keynote Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> Higher-order Homophily is Combinatorially Impossible
                            <span style="width:500px;">Homophily is the seemingly ubiquitous tendency for people to connect with similar others, which is fundamental to how society organizes. Even though many social interactions occur in groups, homophily has traditionally been measured from collections of pairwise interactions involving just two individuals. In this talk, we develop a hypergraph-based framework to quantify homophily from higher-order, group interactions. This framework reveals that, surprisingly, many homophilous group preferences are impossible; for instance, men and women cannot simultaneously exhibit preferences for groups where their gender is the majority. This is not a human behavior but rather a combinatorial impossibility of hypergraphs. We will show that relaxed notions of group homophily appear in numerous contexts, albeit with subtleties. For example, U.S. members of Congress exhibit strong tendencies for cosponsoring bills with same-party cosponsors, but in order for this to be possible, there must be a substantial number of individuals from each party that are willing to cosponsor bills when their party is in the minority. We also examine gender distribution in group pictures with varying group sizes and find several differences from graph-based measures.

                          Invited Talk: <span class="dropt" title="Abstract"> A bounded-confidence model on hypergraphs
                            <span style="width:500px;">
                              In the study of opinion dynamics on networks, one
                              often encodes interactions between people in the
                              form of dyadic relationships, but many social
                              interactions in real life are polyadic (i.e., they
                              involve three or more people). In this talk, I'll
                              discuss our extension of an asynchronous
                              bounded-confidence model (BCM) to hypergraphs. We
                              show that our hypergraph BCM converges to
                              consensus under a wide range of initial conditions
                              for the opinions of the nodes. We also show that
                              there is a phase transition in the convergence
                              time on the complete hypergraph when the variance
                              of the initial opinion distribution equals the
                              confidence bound c. Therefore, to determine the
                              convergence properties of our hypergraph BCM when
                              the variance and the number of hyperedges are both
                              large, it is necessary to use analytical methods
                              instead of relying only on Monte Carlo
                              simulations.  Finally, we also observe a
                              phenomenon that is not possible in standard dyadic
                              BCMs: the opinions of individuals can sometimes
                              jump from one opinion cluster to another in a
                              single time step (we call this “opinion
                              jumping”). This work is a collaboration with

                            Detectability of Communities in Heterogeneous Hypergraphs
                            <span style="width:500px;">
                              The celebrated detectability threshold describes
                              regimes of graphs in which no algorithm can detect
                              the presence of planted communities, even when
                              those communities are truly present and
                              statistically distinct. Several recent papers have
                              offered detectability results for communities in
                              hypergraphs. Those results, however, focus on the
                              case of uniform hypergraphs — hypergraphs in which
                              all edges have the same cardinality. Since most
                              hypergraph data is non-uniform, overcoming the
                              uniformity assumption is an important next
                              step. In this talk, I’ll first give a brief
                              overview of detectability in graphs and uniform
                              hypergraphs. I’ll then describe some ongoing work
                              (joint with Jamie Haddock and Nicole Eikmeier) to
                              extend the theory of hypergraph detectability via
                              higher-order nonbacktracking operators. We offer
                              extensions of the Ihara-Bass determinant formula
                              to two classes of nonbacktracking operators, as
                              well as experimentally-supported results regarding
                              the location of the detectability threshold in
                              non-uniform hypergraphs.

                            <span style="width:500px;">We consider a nonlinear flow on simplicial complexes generated from the simplicial Laplacian, and show that it is a generalization of various consensus and synchronization models commonly studied on networks. In particular, our model allows us to formulate flows on simplices of any dimension, so that it includes edge flows, triangle flows, etc. We show that the system can be represented as the gradient flow of an energy functional, and use this to deduce the stability of various steady states of the model. Finally, we demonstrate that our model contains higher-dimensional analogues of structures seen in related network models.
